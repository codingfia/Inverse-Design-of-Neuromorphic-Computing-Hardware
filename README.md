# Inverse-Design of Neuromorphic Computing Hardware
Pytorch Based Inverse-Design of Neuromorphic Computing Hardware

Utilize the ML-powered engine SpinTorch to engineer a nanomagnonic device functioning as a  neural network, achieving equivalent accuracy with significantly reduced energy consumption.

•	Refine the SpinTorch code to simulate magnonic structures, use machine learning to inverse design optimal magnetic geometry for 100% accuracy in Radio-frquency signal classification.

•	Employed SpinTorch to configure structures as delay-lines, enhancing the system's memory capacity, and validated the improvements through pattern recognition and time series forecasting.
